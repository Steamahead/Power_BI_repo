Introduction
The Analysis of the Adidas US Sales in 2021 is a comprehensive reporting solution designed to analyze and visualize sales data for the Adidas company in the US. It's not a typical sales analysis; instead, it focuses on a specific business problem.

Business problem
The main business problem revolves around calculating sales that meet the defined requirements below:
1. Includes only weeks when the shop has sold at least 4 products or more.
2. Includes only weeks when the shop has had the sale at the level of 100,000 dollars.
3. Prominent sale is the sale that accounts for at least 2% of weekly sales.
4. The grain of the fact table is daily.

In addition to the core business problem, the analysis aims to address additional aspects such as:
1. Sales performance.
   •	Understanding the overall sales performance of the store with the forecast for 1Q of 2022.
   •	Analyzing sales by products.
3. Product analysis
   •	Identifying the top-selling products.
   •	Assessing the performance and profitability of different products.

By addressing these challenges, the analysis aims to empower the Adidas management with actionable insights to make informed business decisions.
